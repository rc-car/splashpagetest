# splashpagetest
Having trouble deploying this splash page on iPhone 6 devices. So far I have found it to work on most other iOS devices. Can anyone get this working on an iPhone6? 

Here is a live link of it: https://zen-yonath-3f6542.netlify.com. If it goes to google after clicking on the image, it works.
